## Summary
This portfolio website serves as an online CV and blog. In addition, it's creation and development allows me to further hone the necessary skills needed. 

## Steps
 - The initial repository and index page were created according to instructions from `https://pages.github.com/`.
 - I then procured a free custom domain name from `https://www.names.co.uk/`.
 - The DNS settings were then configured to ensure the procured domain `http://joshuaakingbade.co.uk/` worked properly.
 - The CNAME and A records were set to point towards gitHub pages, also a CNAME file was created within the repository which stores the custom domain name.

## Plans/Goals
 - Look at and learn from other websites for inspiration as to the layout and functianality of the website.
 - Begin learning **JavaScript** as well as its frameworks, to help with the development of the website.
